Dataset Folder Hierarchy Structure:

	data
		- parameters: contains file lists for nominal and adverse events. Also contains a list of parameter names
		- raw_data: contains raw csv files of the data (one csv file = 1 sample)
		- cached_data.h5: this is a file that's generated by the program to quickly reload data without having to reimport .csv files
	
	output:
		- model_output_summary.txt: samples, precision metrics, and other information used to improve or reproduce a model
		- jpg, png, pdf files: outputs from any of the program's visualization algorithms
	
	model_saves:
		- data.pkl: pickled (saved) versions of the data + predictions so that we can reload and visualize without running/training the model again
		- model_container.pkl: the container and all other parameters for the model (aside from the model itself)
		- keras_model.h5: the model itself (since it can't be serialized with pickle)
		- note: these names are specified by the config file, the listed ones are just the defaults 


	misc
		- model_archive: automatically archived models and json files (may be removed or revamped in the future)

	DTMIL_config.json: configuration file for this dataset
 
Usage:	

	Training the model: To execute the program, run begin_DMIL.py from the "source" folder. You can change parameters without touching the source code by editing ‚ÄúDTMIL_config.json‚Äù, which is in the root folder of your dataset.
	 
	Visualizing the model: visualizations.py has several functions to use for visualizing the model (documentation for this coming soon!)




Notes: To use requirements.txt input the command ‚Äúpip install -r requirements.txt‚Äù in the "workingBranch" directory. It should install all needed dependancies

You can change the structure of any datasets you use by editing DTMIL_config_dir.json in the source folder. Overall, this JSON file is meant to be static, however.

If you want to use this on a machine without a GUI, you need to set the saveFigures parameter to 1. Otherwise, the program will try to visualize the graphs and crash. This will hopefully be fixed in the future

Your dataset should be in the format of the example_directory_structure folder in the "datasets" directory.
