# ADOPT

Although aviation accidents are rare, safety incidents occur more frequently and require a careful analysis to detect and mitigate risks in a timely manner. Analyzing safety incidents using operational data and producing event-based explanations is invaluable to airline companies as well as to governing organizations such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States. However, this task is challenging because of the complexity involved in mining multi-dimensional heterogeneous time series data, the lack of time-step-wise annotation of events in a flight, and the lack of scalable tools to perform analysis over a large number of events. We propose a precursor mining algorithm: Automatic Discovery of Precursors in Time series data (ADOPT) that identifies events in the multidimensional time series that are correlated with the safety incident. Precursors are valuable to systems health and safety monitoring and in explaining and forecasting safety incidents. Current methods suffer from poor scalability to high dimensional time series data and are inefficient in capturing temporal behavior. We propose an approach by combining multiple-instance learning (MIL) and deep recurrent neural networks (DRNN) to take advantage of MIL's ability to learn using weakly supervised data and DRNN's ability to model temporal behavior. 


The objective of this project is to automate the analysis of flight safety incidents in a way that scales well and offers explanations. These explanations include:

* When the degraded states start to appear?
* What are the degraded states?
* What is the likelihood of the event is to occur?
* What corrective actions can be taken?

This project aims to:

* Create a novel deep temporal multiple-instance learning (DT-MIL) framework that combines multiple-instance learning with deep recurrent neural networks suitable for weakly-supervised learning problems involving time series or sequential data. 
* Provide a novel approach to explaining safety incidents using precursors mined from data.
* Deliver a detailed evaluation of the DT-MIL model using real-world aviation data and comparison with baseline models. 
* Perform a precursor analysis and explanation of high speed exceedance safety incident using flight data from a commercial airline
